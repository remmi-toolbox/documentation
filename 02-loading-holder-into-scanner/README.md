#User Manual Part 2: Loading Holder into Scanner  
*Note: Protocol may vary depending on the strength of scanner and type of RF coil*

1. Positioning the holder with the "BACK" side facing up, flip the holder 360 degrees to trap any existing air bubbles away from the brains. See figure:

2. After trapping air bubbles, place the holder in RF coil. Our lab uses 25mm litz coil. The part of the holder labeled "BACK" should be positioned on the side of the coil with wires. The "FRONT" side of the coil gets inserted into magnet first.

3. Secure the holder in the coil using screws that insert at the side surface of the holder. Additionally, there are two O-ring grooves on each end of the holder that may be used to ensure a tighter fit of the holder in the RF coil if necesary. Note: if the holder is removed from the RF coil at any time, it is important to repeat the step of trapping air bubbles before repositioning back in the coil.

4. Make sure to be completely demagnetized for safety purposes. Place entire RF coil in the scanner with the "FRONT" side getting inserted first. Tune and match.
