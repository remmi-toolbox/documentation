# User Manual Part 3: Setting up & Running Scans  
*Note: Protocol may need to be adjusted depending on RF coil, strength of scanner, application, and desired images*

1. Launch PV6 0.1 application on MRI scanner computer.
2. Click "File" in upper left corner and click "New/Study." Title new study appropriately. Click "Create" and then "Exam."

3. In the "Palette" window, click Mouse for "Object," Head for "Region," and Anatomy for "Application." Click and drag "1_Localizer" to "Examination" window on the right. Hit "Apply" then "Continue" to run scan.

4. In the "Palette" window, under the Application option, click "REMMI." Click and drag "T1\_FLASH\_axial" and "T1\_FLASH\_coronal." Adjust the Field of View (FOV) in the "Routine" tab and offsets in the "Geometry" tab if necesary to ensure the brains are contained within the FOV for both scans. To do so, double click on the scan and edit the FOV and geometry offset values. Hit "Apply." Double click T1\_FLASH\_axial, then hit "Continue."

5. In the "Palette" window, under Object: "Mouse", Region: "Head," and Application: "REMMI," click and drag "HRANAT\_3D\_4MB" to "Examination" window.

6. Click on the "Adjustment Platform" icon in the upper left corner of the "Examination" window.

7. Double click "B0 Map" at bottom. Uncheck "Fat/Water Inphase Condition." Uncheck "Use default FOV." Change FOV to 22mm for all three orientations. Set echo spacing to the smallest value possible. Make sure "Minimize TE" is checked at top, and change "Flip Angle" to 25Â°. Click "Start." Once B0 map is obtained (a green checkmark will appear), hit "Apply" and then "Back."

8. Now we want to shim over the B0 map, so double click on HRANAT scan. Click the "Setup" tab then click "Autoshim" tab. Click "Mapshim." For "Shim up to," click "ThirdOrder." Click "Iterative Correction." Click "Automatic Shim Volume" and set "Shim Volume Margin" to 22mm for all three parameters. For "Shape of shim volume," click "Cuboid." Click "Apply."

9. Click on "Adjustment Platorm" icon. Double click "Scan Shim" and click "Start." Once finished click "Apply" then "Back."

10. Now load "SIR\_3D\_4MB" and "DTI\_3D\_4MB" by clicking and dragging them from "Palette" window to "Examination" window.

11. Make sure that the brains scanned with the T1_FLASH  scans fit in the FOV for the HRANAT scan. To do this, double click the T1\_FLASH\_axial scan and drag it up to the top of the "Examination" window to view the images. Then, click on HRANAT\_3D\_4MB scan. A blue box will appear over the images of the brains. Make sure all of the brains fit within this blue box that is displayed. Click through the slices to make sure. There will be an orange dot at the center of these blue boxes. Try to get the orange dot positioned in the center of the four brains. To do this, fix the offsets in the "Geometry" tab. Then click "Apply." Repeat for T1\_FLASH\_coronal.
12. If you adjusted the offsets for the "HR\_ANAT\_3D\_4MB" scan, you must transfer those offsets to the SIR and DTI scans. If you did not adjust offsets, skip to step 13. To transfer the value of the new offsets: the first, second, and third offset values correspond to the first, second, and third field of view values, respectively. Match the corresponding values from the HRANAT scan to the SIR scan. Once the offsets have been adjusted appropriately, hit "Apply". Repeat with the DTI scan. Once done, double click on each of the three scans and make sure the blue box does not shift as you switch between them. If it does, that could indicate that you transferred the offsets wrong. Go back and double check. 
13. Double click on the "HRANAT\_3D\_4MB" scan in the "Examination" window. Go to "Setup" and click "Shim." Look at the shim values, and make sure that the fourth order shim is zero. If it is not zero, manually change that value to zero. Hit "Apply."

14. Make sure the little man icon on the left of each scan name has a downward facing shovel (refer to annotated screenshot below). If it doesn't, double click the scan, and hit "Apply." Highlight all three scans and click "Continue." Note the name of file and the experiment number for each of the three scans.

15. Once scans are completed, take holder out of the scanner, and place brains back in their proper tubes in the refrigerator.
